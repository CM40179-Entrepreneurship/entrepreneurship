## Examples

this should show example features as you scroll, so show things as you scroll. So an image of a shop, and then as you scroll it highlights all of the things that our system could highlight on the image, so it will show shoplifting, lack of stock, spillage on the floor etc. These will all be on the image already which I will provide, so I just need this higlighted on the same image as you scroll, with explanations to the side as you scroll
