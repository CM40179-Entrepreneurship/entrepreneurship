## General purpose competitors overview

### Sensing features

- Nest, Arlo, Ring, Eufy all offer alerts, based off motion sensing, this is not that useful to our goal, of providing custom alerts
- However, some offer more granular alerts, as shown in the table

|      | Sound detection | Familar faces | Specific alerts (e.g. vehicle,package) | AI search                                          |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Ring | X               | X             | X (Person, package, vehicle)           | X (You can search for events containing a red car) |
| Arlo |                 |               | X (Person, package, vehicle)           |                                                    |
| Nest | X               | X             | X (Person, package, vehicle)           |                                                    |
| Eufy |                 |               | X (Person, pet)                        |                                                    |
| Wyze |                 |               | X (Person pet)                         |                                                    |

- These aren't really competitors
  - They are providing hardware and software
  - But alerting solutions are limited to did something happen with a human in this box
  - Ring gets the closest with it's AI search technology
  - This poses a potential challenge, they have the technology to translate nlp -> matching alerts
  - So they could probably quite easily add an alerting feature to this, however they don't do this at the moment

## Saas competitors

- Genetec
  - Integrates all of your existing video hardware
  - Allows for AI search, e.g. a red car within the last two hours
  - But you can't search for **anything**
  - Has alarms, but not based on this AI search
- Kinesense,
  - More of an enterprise level solution
  - Allows for searching through lots of CCTV data, but retrospectively
  - Does not provide alerting as far as I can see
- **KENVISION**
  - This does provide alerting for critical events
  - As well as NLP for alerts
  - It also integrates into a currently existing system
  - I couldn't find a demo, but there system seems to be super similar to what we're offering based on what was on their website
- Verkada
  - Offers ai search
- Kenvision gets the closest out of these to a competitor, from their website it seems they are offering a solution very similar to ours. However, I can't find a demo, so we would have to do more research to confirm this.

## Accident prevention

- Iris+ fall detection

  - Offers fall detection from video cameras, based of dection
  - It also provides a lot of other features, I couldn't see if it uses NLP to do anything, but it does have
    - Loitering
    - Crowd counting
    - Anomaly detection
    - Search for similar
    - Perimter detection
    - Facial recognition
    - etc...
  - So this does seem to be quite similar to what we're offering, as it does offer lots of alerts:

- Others I could find focusing on accident prevention

  - SafelyYou
  - KamiCare
  - Pentegra systems
  - FallCall solutions

- Focusing in on our idea of looking at accident prevention instead of other uses (e.g. shoplifting) there are already a lot of competitors in this space
  - lots of systems that allow for fall detection
  - And one system that includes fall detection amongst lots of other features

## Our offering

- We plan on translating NLP instructions -> video alerts
- And sending these alerts over whatsapp
- We had suggested that this could be useful to do in the care space, however, reserach has confirmed this is a crowded market
- The only solution I could find that can take any NLP instruction to an alert is Kenvision
