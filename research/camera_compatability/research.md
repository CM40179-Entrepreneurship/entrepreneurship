# Challenging Camera Compatibility Assumption
    "Investigate top cameras (e.g., Hikvision, Reolink, Dahua) that support RTSP/ONVIF, including adoption statistics and the likelihood that owners use connected apps."



## Hikvision
- Integrates with both RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) and ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum)

## Reolink
- Integrates with both, I think except their battery powered ones

## Dahua
- Offer all functionality that we've spoken about already
- For example https://www.dahuasecurity.com/products/All-Products/Dedicated-Products/Project-Exclusive/PTZ-Cameras/SD8A840WA-HNF(For-project-only)
- Already have deep learning integrated within them, e.g., for "auto tracking and perimeter protection"
- Sanctioned in UK government buildings, Australia's Department of Defence, Ukraine and Quebec from 2022-2023



## Usage
Dahua and Hikvision supply 40% of global market for surveillance cameras

Neither Hikvision, Reolink or Dahua are cloud reliant and all have email and push notifications

Reolink placed #1160 in US in all categories and #76 in US for communication suggesting high usage already
