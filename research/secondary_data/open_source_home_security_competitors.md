“Is it just me, or has Ring started to lag behind in innovation? Other smart home brands are stepping up with 2K resolution cameras and dual camera systems, yet Ring seems to be content with adding a ‘birds eye’ feature to its Pro model and hiking up the price by $70. Their new indoor camera? Just a rehash of the old model with a different cover, lacking any significant updates or features. I was hoping for exciting announcements at CES, but they had nothing noteworthy. Remember when they introduced the Car Cam and they demoed Drone Cam last year? It’s baffling why they haven’t combined Blink and Ring into a single entity, maybe called ‘Bling by Ring.’ It feels like Amazon is following in Google’s footsteps, becoming a place where companies lose their innovative edge.
