### Purpose of the meeting:
- Decide what to do next, market validation/research

---

Next steps:
- Cast out wide net, talk with local business, see if any are willing to pay for our product - Who is actually willing to buy this?
- Divvy up tasks and get tangible results/work


Research done so far:
- Evan went to store in Twickenham and got some feedback and contact details.


How do we carry out market research?
- Go directly to businesses
- Bring A4 handout
- Ask the business about it's problems in various domains (fall detection, theft, tracking items)
- Propose solution to the problem and ask for feedback, and how they could see themselves using it.
- Suggested to be done in teams

Want to propose the solution as an upgrade to existing CCTV cameras by integrating modern technology
- Design a survey carefully to not introduce bias too by showing example images of, for example, rats in Dominoes pizza shop
- Picture and product to spike interest when talking to customers

Need to calculate cost of inference for each business and setup costs for each business, have to make sure it is less than the fee that would be charged

*Manifest it - "attract not chase"*
