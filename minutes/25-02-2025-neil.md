## Meeting with Neil

Neil:

- Good idea, suicide prevention is also valid, not just for profit business, we could do both.
- Mention that we have done suicide prevention in the report, our nlp could have lots of applications.
- Underdeveloped as a market.
- Cutting edge models being brought in has potential, focus on the **ease** of use.

## Deliverable 1

- Don't focus too much on professionalising, we want it to be crisp, clear, creative.
- The best ones are very rough and ready, focus on working on the idea.
- Focus needs to be on going ahead with the idea, starting the start-up, this will get marks.
- Focus should be on building the things, "nothing beats working software".

## Market research

- Is going round and talking to business a good idea? Yes
- Impact on ethics? Ask Bhagy, don't need anything formal.

## Next steps

- The more thorough we are with notes, the better the marks. Document where we had discrepancies.
- **Bring in the social aspect**.
- It doesn't have to be successful to get marks, yoo can do interviews, and nobody says they need it, this will still get marks.
- Focus on building a brand.
- Anything that has brought us to this point can be included.
- Face detection is a potential market
- Having a customer is super helpful, lots of people have an MVP but not customer.
- Add Angel investor feedback to the repo.
- Invite Bhagy and Neil to the repo.
