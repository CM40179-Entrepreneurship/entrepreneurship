Distributors -
They:
1. know all local cctv holders in the local area.
2. experts in the subject. we are not. we are AI/integration/software developers 
3. they sell software as well as hardware
4. if we manage to find something clients care about... they can sell our software...
5. local knowledge of crimes/problems/etc

trial approach in Bris/Bath. - if works, rinse.repeat

Had several chats with the guy. - Pete
I saw his youtube channel that reviews products and called him to ask him what night time cameras to deploy in suicide prevention.
he offered to send free infared cameras.
never did.
asked for my address.
never did.
called him up again to show him Ellie - YT video (Dec 27th).
he thought it was cool. said their client (JD Sports) wanted heatmap generation
he said he can hook us up.
he's not the most reliable because he's very busy
told me a lot about security landscape.

##  sanctions - src: Pete/Christian/
Pete told me about the impending sanctions doom from China - no real DR plan. .
apparently its never been proven that IP addresses - i.e. they don't think its a real security threat... but government still wants to do it anyway. similar to Huawei etc

^^ on the back of the sanctions thing (another thing Christian mentioned)
this was mentioned twice. 
checked this again with Guy who runs the Suicide Prevention technology team on the second biggest risk spot in the UK - Humber Bridge (can't remember his name but can get it and set up another call) (Jan 10th)

He also said the same as Pete.
He used to run the cctv ops for a construction company and hardware shop (it was a joint venture):
he said they used hikvision shoplifting. as this was common for construction 
like tiktok one option would be for the UK to buy the software arm of Hikvision.
on a real on the back of this informaton. it could be completely viable to clone this software and just make it reliable....
even if the sanctions don't ever happen, its still a risk for companies, and could be the UK.
