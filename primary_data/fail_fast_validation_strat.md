fail fast in each catgory: 3

## independent shops [corner stores, grocery, hardware, clothes, independent, please CCTV]. pubs [especially dodgier ones]. more clients fit in here. anyone with property for its protection.
handouts.
I found by speaking to corner stores, there has been communication barriers, wish I had print outs and yes/nos.
I had two good conversations related to shoplifting in Twickenham.
Handouts: **heatmap generation, shoplifting, spills, fire, knife (armed burgulary), rodent detection, 
Missing: unattended customer, customer needs help (Sainsburys and M&S have this system already fyi)
if we get 0 signs of yes (we failed)

## care homes. 
falls
nightime alerts
distress alerts
can't get up classification. i.e. stuck in chair.
really important but staff identification as well as visitors ID. massive problem. was really throughough when I went to see my dad.
morale warning for person: this could be pretty saturated. lots of products. Mark Bloom wasnt keen. but we should still investigate
if we get 0 follow up conversations (we failed)

## consumer - Viral / reddit / LinkedIn / Facebook - video - people on commutes bored worrying sitting down on the train - probably have money
Online.
Can use targeted advertising. i.e. advertiser IDS know if person has already bought a similar CCTV.
I personally buy something if theres a flashy video /demo. or at least register for interest
Got a really big network here as a collective.
I think we could reach many, but I don't necesarilly think it will reach people with home cctv.... (assumption)
however I genuinely think the video (with some more versions for different channels could be shared in whatsapp group chats)
links to online PREORDER / REGISTER FOR INTEREST FORM
if we get 0 follow up conversations (we failed)
## Videos: Europe / UK Audience
Families: dog escape video. wheres my macbook. movement near medicine cabinet. contextualised danger for kids etc. 
Crime:
- can post on Facebook community crime things. I got added to Trowbridges 999 group. where they post local cctv videos. my road even has one. would be easy to spam
Elderly care:
- subchannels for carers, need to flesh out how to reach these people.
### Other Concept Hype Videos
Twilio: go from fire to receiving an AI generated mobile phone call. or even video call.. bears (US/Canada Audience)... medicine / booze cabinet motion. child falls in pool.
i,e, this demos a full stack security guard if it watches and can call you. very YC to me.

## Home - but elderley focus - I think this is a really important nice-  I would use the system myself for my parents and grandparents. many would
I think this weird in between niche is actually between care homes and consumers/homes/as the care home takes the responsibility of care away from homes. but many vulnerable / elderly desire to live independently even thought its risky.
all the stories I hear of accidents are here. also dementia speciality. people escape. it is a lot of money to fund (if private).
i.e. falls and other struggle and abnormal behaviours.
